          Hi, my name is Fernando. I built my first computer in middle school after being introduced to hardware and software at a young age by a CNC programmer (who was my grandfather). I  live for and enjoy programming, IT, networking, cyber security, and data analysis.

          I am always willing to learn more programming languages and frameworks!! The framework I currently use Javascript React, its great! I also like backend development too. I used firebase for the backend and React for the frontend in the projects below .

          I'm on the quest to get CompTIA Certifications. So far I have 1, which is the Comptia ITF+ (CompTIA IT Foundamentals+) I'm currently studying the new updated A+ and Network+ The next one I will get is Comptia A+ but I'm also looking forward to getting CompTIA Security+ which focuses on Cyber Security. I want these certifications because they come across a lot of programming concepts needed to have safer apps, servers, and networks, which is what I want to do. 

          I would also like to learn more about Data analytics as I have enjoyed developing graphics in apps and websites!

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I love spending time learning about programming and the IT world. I could
          spend hours learning about programming. Outside of programming, I spend time with my kids and
          watch sports. I used to play soccer but now a days I rather watch
          sports and listen to music.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the moment I'm becoming better and better at React and I'm really enjoying it!!
          I will not say I have mastered React because I haven't. But, I have enjoyed what I have built with it. I'm looking forward to gain more expierence developing!
          <br />
          I've enjoyed working with API's in react. Building graphs, and pulling images from interesting API's to display in the fast lovely react is great!
          <br /> 
          I've been using hooks, which are so much fun and wish to continue using them to see what other great things I can build with them!
        </p>
        Firebase in react has also been a great recent expierence learning!

        <h3>Pokemon App Version 2</h3>
        
        <hr />
        <p>
          For this React app I used hooks to fetch Api information,
          I also added a simple graph and images all from the pokemon API.
          I wish I could have added an authentication portal and another graph that would calculate an overall score for the pokemon., calculated from variables from the api of course.

        <hr />
        <p>
          This React app was just like the Pokemon app, I pulled data from the API and changed it to string to see what data I could work with. 

          <br>
          I was thinking about going back to this app and adding a graphic giving an overall score for the card and better grahpic user interface.

        <hr />
        <p>
          I used firebase to do the backend authentication process. This app is very simple but it works! In version 2 it would be awesome to add router to it in order to display membership content in the same and different pages.
